**[点击此处阅读中文文档](/Readme-CN.md)**


## What is the Hoslor language?

This is an artistic constructed language, also referring to the repository called Hoslor-Conlang on Github.

It was born out of drafts on April 9, 2023 and was officially approved by the author [umiaq]( https://github.com/umiarsualivik) build on Github.


## Why do I construct this language?

- To attempt to put ONE language into several conworlds, say, taking an anti-traditional path of multi-conworlds serving ONE language.
- To Formalize the language which had existed on drafts for many years, and fulfilling the dreams of my childhood.
- To inspect how "enthusiastic" in linguistics I am. ( #-_-)


## Why do I choose this platform?

- Github is an outstanding community and project hosting platform.
- For major demand, and take this time I want to train how to use Github. ( #-_-)
- It isn't limited to the necessary modules, but also has some plugins such as inputting method.
    > To be frank, It's difficult to implement in a short time due to the my energy and ability.I'm so sorry.
